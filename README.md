## How to use

### Download the software

Compile it yourself, or [download the latest release from HERE](https://github.com/VFansss/comquiz/releases/)

### How to load quizzes

You can load quizzes from any .txt file is a compatible format.

You can manually create a .txt file that is compatible with any of the below 'From file' format convention

#### From file - Pipe format

##### Explanation

In this format, the file will contain a series of **pipes** (this character ---> | <---) to discern `question body` and `question answers`.

A `question block` will be defined when the parsed encounter five pipes (---> ||||| <---). This will define a new "block" where the software expect to find `question body` and `question answers`. Answers can be `wrong answers` or `right answers`

- Question body

  Any text **after** two pipes. e.g.

  ```text
  || What's the capital of France?
  ```

- Wrong answer

  A pipe character and a minus character (---> |- <---)

  ```text
  |- Monaco
  ```

- Right answer

  A pipe character and a plus character (---> |+ <---)

  ```text
  |+ Paris
  ```

:exclamation: Beware of any space or special character at the start of the file! Quizzes in this format **MUSTS** start with five pipes (---> ||||| <---)

:exclamation: A `question block` is valid when it has ONE `question body` and at least ONE `right answer`.

:exclamation: If any of the above condition fail, the quiz will be considered invalid and will not load.

##### Example

```text
|||||
|| What is the capital of Myanmar?

|+a. Naypyidaw
|-b. Hồ Chí Minh
|-c. Bari
|-d. Nan-ching

|||||
|| Which of these European cities are the two most populous?

|-a. London
|+b. Moscow
|-c. Madrid
|+d. Istanbul
|-e. Berlin
|-f. Milan
|-g. Dublin
```
